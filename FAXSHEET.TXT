                    Announcing MidiLab/2 Version 3.0

MidiLab/2 is a MIDI Sequencer, Editor and data manager application for OS/2
Version 3 (Warp). Its primary functions- Record, Overdub, Playback, and Track Edit,
and the other supporting functions, are controlled by CUA compliant PM user
interface controls.

MidiLab/2 exploits the power of OS/2, including 32-bit operation,
multi-threading, and Presentation Manager functions.  It features minimal
hardware and storage requirements while providing a high level of function
and performance.  MidiLab/2 supports the MIDI 1.0 File Specification.
There are no special hardware nor software requirements other than a Roland
MPU-401/IPC/IMC MIDI Processing Unit (or a compatible OEM unit which emulates
the MPU in UART mode), and any system capable of running OS/2 Version 3.

While a musician unfamiliar with computers should be able to readily
use MidiLab/2 as a multi-track recorder, its full capability can best be
realized with a reasonable knowledge of MIDI concepts and terminology, and
general computer operation.  It is assumed the user is familiar with
MIDI-compatible equipment, and is aware of the role of a sequencer in a
MIDI-based audio system.

MidiLab/2 targets the Multimedia creator, the MIDI musician, and
hobbyists/home users in general as potential users of the program.

- Full exploitation of OS/2
